# surfs_up
Analysis:
In the Surfs Up Challenge I queried the date and measurment tables to retrieve all the temperatures for June and a second query for December to help W. Avy devide if she should open a surf shop. The queries were done using Pandas functions and methods and SQLalchemy to filter the date columns. It was also important to locate the statistical data for both periods. 
Results:
-The June temperatures ranged from 64 degrees to 80 degrees.
-Decemeber temperatures ranged from 65 degrees to 78. 
-The average temperature (mean) was 74.9 for June and 71.0 for Decemeber. 
Conclusion:
I would suggest that W. Avy lok into several more factors before opening her surf shop. The temperature doesn't fluctuate an extreme amount between the six months that we queried. People enjoy a temperate climate and won't be in unbearably cold or warm temperatures. However I suggest that W. Avy look into other data before starting her business. It is important to also know how much tourism will be occuring at those points of the year to make sure the business will be sustainable. W. Avy should also look at factors of competing businesses in the area and socioeconimics before making her decision.
